# Title → Hook → Share (Positivity-first)

> **AI-GUIDANCE**: Use this guide to write titles that earn the click, hooks that keep people reading, and share moments that earn the forward/share.

---

## Overview

Think of your opening as a 3-stage funnel:

1. **Title** earns the click
2. **Hook** earns the next paragraph
3. **Share moments** earn the forward/share

This workflow is **positivity-first** (no anger/fear). It aims for relief, agency, hope, belonging, curiosity, and awe.

## Quickstart (use this, skip the rest)

1. Write **10 title options** using the templates below; pick the clearest 1–3.
2. Write a **2-paragraph hook**:
   - Paragraph 1: a specific, relatable situation (make them nod “yes”)
   - Paragraph 2: what changed + your promise + what they’ll get
3. Add **1–2 share seeds** in the first page:
   - a perspective shift (awe) + a concrete takeaway (practical value)
4. Add an optional **share prompt** near the first strong takeaway.

Template:
```text
Title:
Hook P1 (situation):
Hook P2 (promise):
Share seed (awe line):
Share seed (practical takeaway):
Share prompt (optional):
```

## Research-backed share levers (positivity-first)

If you care about sharing, these traits are strongly associated with virality in an analysis of New York Times “most-emailed” articles (Berger & Milkman; summarized in GfK MIR 2013):

| Trait | Share lift | Use it (positively) |
|------|-----------:|---------------------|
| **Practical value** | **+30%** | Checklists, steps, templates people feel good sending |
| **Awe** | **+30%** | A genuine perspective shift (“I didn’t realize…”) |
| **Interest** | **+25%** | Curiosity gaps + novel angles (no doom) |
| **Surprise** | **+14%** | Counterintuitive but reassuring insights |
| **Positivity** | **+13%** | Hope, relief, agency, “you can do this” |

Note: anger (+34%) and anxiety (+21%) also spread in that dataset, but skip them if you’re building a positivity-first brand.

## Title templates (click)

- **Benefit + specificity**: “{Result} in {time} (without {common frustration})”
- **Contrarian (kind)**: “Most advice about {topic} misses this one thing”
- **Identity**: “If you’re {who}, this will feel familiar”
- **Story**: “I tried {approach} for {time}. Here’s what changed”
- **Numbered**: “{X} rules that made {result} finally stick”

## Share techniques (spread)

- **Make it useful to pass on**: distill a checklist, diagram, or “do this next” sequence.
- **Give a clean quote**: one sentence that names a feeling or reframes a problem.
- **Let them look good**: frame sharing as helping someone else (“send this to a friend who…”).

## Legendary Copywriters: Top Techniques

### David Ogilvy — "Father of Advertising"
> "On average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy."

**Key Rules:**
1. **Headlines = 80% of the work** — If your headline fails, everything fails
2. **Promise a benefit** — Tell readers what's in it for them
3. **Be instantly comprehensible** — No cleverness that confuses
4. **Write 20 headlines** — Then test to find the winner
5. **First paragraph must "grab"** — Make it impossible to stop reading

**Power Words That Work:**
- "How to..." | "Introducing..." | "Amazing..." | "Finally..."

---

### Gary Halbert — "Prince of Print"
> "Curiosity is the single most persuasive sales technique."

**Key Rules:**
1. **Create an "itch"** — Leave something incomplete so readers MUST continue
2. **Address readers by name** — Make copy feel personal, not like advertising
3. **AIDA always works** — Attention → Interest → Desire → Action
4. **Eye relief matters** — Short sentences, short paragraphs, easy flow
5. **"A-pile vs B-pile"** — Make your content feel personal, not promotional

**Famous Hook:**
> "The Amazing Money-Making Secret Of A Desperate Nerd From Ohio!"

---

### Eugene Schwartz — "Breakthrough Advertising"
> "Copy cannot create desire. It can only channel existing desire."

**Key Rules:**
1. **80% research, 20% writing** — Know your audience deeply
2. **Match market awareness** — Different hooks for different awareness levels
3. **Write to the "chimpanzee brain"** — Simple, clear, direct
4. **Show results, not stuff** — Focus on transformation, not features
5. **Listen like crazy** — Understand hidden emotions and desires

**Headline Formula:**
> Proof + Friction + Benefit = Compelling Hook

Example: "Burn Disease Out of Your Body Using Nothing More Than the Palm of Your Hand!"

---

### Joe Sugarman — "The Slippery Slide"
> "The sole purpose of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence."

**Key Rules:**
1. **Slippery slide effect** — Each sentence pulls you to the next
2. **Get early agreement** — Start with truths readers will nod to
3. **Sell a concept, not a product** — Position around a bigger idea
4. **Emotion + Logic** — Hook with feeling, justify with reason
5. **Anticipate objections** — Answer concerns before they arise

**Immediate Engagement Technique:**
> Get readers saying "yes" early. The more yeses, the more likely they'll say yes to your offer.

## Copywriting Frameworks

### 1. PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

**Best for:** Hobbies that solve a pain point

Positivity-first variant: **Problem → Empathize → Solution** (skip the “agitate” step).

```
Problem:  "Feeling disconnected from nature?"
Agitate:  "Screen time and city life drain your energy."
Solution: "Hiking reconnects you to wild spaces and yourself."
```

**Hook Examples:**
- **Hiking**: "Stuck behind screens all day? The trail is calling."
- **Nutrition**: "Tired of diet confusion? One meal philosophy, endless energy."
- **Systems**: "Drowning in manual tasks? Automate the boring stuff."

---

### 2. AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

**Best for:** Inspiring hobbies with aspirational appeal

```
Attention: Shocking stat or bold claim
Interest:  How it works/what it offers
Desire:    The transformation promised
Action:    What to do next
```

**Hook Examples:**
- **Cycling**: "100 million Americans ride. Here's why I'm one of them."
- **Archery**: "One arrow. One breath. Total focus."
- **Markets**: "The stock market moves $200B daily. Want in?"

## Writing Checklist

- [ ] **Under 20 words** — Keep it punchy
- [ ] **Uses "you" or implies reader** — Makes it personal
- [ ] **Creates curiosity** — Why keep reading?
- [ ] **Connects to benefit** — What's in it for them?
- [ ] **Matches hobby tone** — Active hobbies = active voice

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

❌ **Too generic**: "Welcome to my hiking page"
❌ **Too salesy**: "Buy now for amazing results!"
❌ **Too long**: Hooks over 2 sentences lose impact
❌ **Jargon-heavy**: "Optimize your nutritional macros"
❌ **No emotion**: Flat, factual statements without energy

## After the hook (research, outlines, SEO)

This workflow focuses on **Title → Hook → Share**. For research, keyword mapping, outlines, and competitor analysis, use:

- `/web-search-workflow` (engines + saved searches)
- `/keyword-guide` (keyword extraction/validation)
- `/research-project` (structured research + synthesis)
- `/creative-writing` (blog post planning + drafting)
